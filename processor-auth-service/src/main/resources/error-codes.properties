# This file defines all errors encountered while using the app. Each one includes an error code and a human-readable message.
# Note that these error codes are only responsible for providing short coarse-grained information about an error, while
# detail messages (declared in the "errors" file) should provide specific information about the circumstance/problem.
# To make the usage of error codes easier for developers, you should define an Enum to hold all the defined ones,
# by which dev can inject 1 appropriate instance to BaseResponse every time an exception is caught.
